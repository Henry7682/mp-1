    <h3> My information</h3>
    <p> I am a dedicated and enthusiastic senior at Boston University, majoring in Computer Science, set to graduate in 2025.
        Passionate about software development and problem-solving, I have built a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and full-stack web development.

        Throughout my studies, I have worked on various projects, including developing web applications, creating automation scripts, and experimenting with artificial intelligence models.
        My coursework in embedded systems, computer networks, and software engineering has further expanded my technical expertise.

        In addition to my academic pursuits, I have participated in hackathons and coding competitions, where I collaborated with peers to create innovative solutions under tight deadlines.
        I enjoy tackling challenging coding problems and continuously strive to improve my skills by learning new technologies.

        Beyond programming, I have a strong interest in UI/UX design and software scalability, ensuring that the applications I build are both user-friendly and efficient.
        My goal is to contribute to impactful projects that bridge technology with real-world applications.
